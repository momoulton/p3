    <p>What is &#8220;Lorem Ipsum&#8221;? According to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorem_ipsum" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a>: &#8220;In publishing and graphic design, lorem ipsum (derived from Latin dolorem ipsum, translated as &#8220;pain itself&#8221;) is a filler text commonly used to demonstrate the graphic elements of a document or visual presentation. Replacing meaningful content with placeholder text allows viewers to focus on graphic aspects such as font, typography, and page layout without being distracted by the content. It also reduces the need for the designer to come up with meaningful text, as they can instead use quickly-generated lorem ipsum. The lorem ipsum text is typically a scrambled section of De finibus bonorum et malorum, a 1st-century BC Latin text by Cicero, with words altered, added, and removed to make it nonsensical, improper Latin.&#8221;</p>
